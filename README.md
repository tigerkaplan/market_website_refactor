Week 1 challenge 

# Seo_Market_Refactor

The project is for completing challenge Week 1 for the Front End Developer Boot camp.


## Project Description

The project aims to enhance the semantic elements of the blog by using HTML and CSS coding techniques to improve its SEO. 

I faced some challenges when it came to scaling images and positioning container boxes. I made efforts to align the container boxes on both the left and right sides. 

The implementation of the CSS coding to address these issues will be considered in the future.
## Updates on Project

I have made several improvements to enhance the search engine optimization (SEO) and accessibility of the blog site.

1. The <title> section has been updated.

2. The <header> element has been added to semantically represent the webpage header, aligning with SEO and accessibility best practices.

3. The <nav> navigation menu has been optimized for semantics, signifying that its content consists of navigation links. This enhancement improves both accessibility and SEO.

4. The 'alt' attribute has been added to images to provide text alternatives for users who may not be able to view the images.

5. The <footer> element has been added  to semantically represent the webpage footer.

6. The <aside> element has been added  that enclosed content is related to the main content but can be considered separate.
## Usage

This repository has an improved blog page designed to work better with search engines and make it easier for everyone to use. I used special HTML tags like <title>, <nav>, <header>, <article>, <aside>, <section>, and <footer>, along with 'alt' descriptions for images. 

These changes help the blog perform well in search results and make it more accessible for all visitors.
